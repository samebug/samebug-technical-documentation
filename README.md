# Samebug

Samebug automatically locates relevant solutions to your software crash from its expert community and solution database.

## Search with a stack trace

By [searching](/guide/search) with a [stack trace](/guide/stack-trace) Samebug can provide you a
more relevant [solution](/guide/solution)
to your software crash. You don’t have to browse through endless forums
and developer communities.

## Find relevant solutions to your problem

### Check existing solutions

Our search engine has indexed more than 1,200,000 exceptions and its [solutions](/guide/solution)
from the web. When [searching](/guide/search) with your [stack trace](/guide/stack-trace) we browse through our
continuously growing database and select the most relevant solution.

### Ask for help from other developers

Samebug’s solution database is also run by the community. Based on your search result,
Samebug connects you to other community members, your [Bugmates](/guide/bugmate), who have
the same problem. You can [ask](/guide/help-requests) or [provide](/guide/write-tip)
help to other community members.

### Mark the best solutions

The semantic stack trace similarity algorithm can find the most relevant stack trace, but
not the most relevant content. We need the Community to [rate the solutions](/guide/solution/rating-solutions)
in order to make Samebug learn which solutions work.

## Privacy

[Your stack trace](/guide/privacy) belongs only to you. Once you register, Samebug will never
share your stack trace [without your permission](/guide/workspace).

## Integrated with your IDE

Our integration allows you to get solutions from the database, ask for help from
others with the same bug and write solutions without switching to the internet
and abandoning your workflow. Install it for [IntelliJ Idea](/guide/integration/intellij-idea/install), [Android Studio](/guide/integration/android-studio/install) or [Eclipse](/guide/integration/eclipse).

## Experimental features, feature request

Samebug aggregates a huge amount of information collected from the Internet and from our users.
We want to share this knowledge, and we have a lot of ideas on how to present and use this data,
but it is not our focus. Check our [experimental features](/guide/experimental-features) if you are
interested.

If you have other ideas for what Samebug can be used for, feel free to [contact us](mailto:hello@samebug.io).
